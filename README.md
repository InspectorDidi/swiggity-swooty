_Where to go when you're looking for that booty_
> Originally this repository was going to be focused specifically around information gathering useful during post-exploitation of machines; hence the pirate looting motif with the repo name.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to become an aggregation point for TTPs primarily intended for internal Offensive Security Teams and Redteams but are surely useful to the greater security community. 

A lot of the information provided initially will be from my own private notes that have at this point become unruly to manage. Instead of maintaining a slew of Github Gists, text files on my computer, documents on Google Drive, Dropbox, Dropbox Paper, a NAS, and physical notebooks –all segmented and incredibly difficult to reference effectively– this repository aims to consolidate, categorize, and amalgamate the data.

## Contribution
Contribution is the life of this repository. Sharing your personal arcane dark magic helps enlighten others and provides a platform for exchanging ideas that spark collaboration. 

Contributions need not be mindblowing or 0day to be useful. If you discover something new feel free to issue a PR. Outside of extreme edge cases I expect most PRs to be merged.

## Organization and Quality
As the repository grows and individual notes begin to form logically related groups I have every intention of producing high quality documentation and currating collections of documents. Whenever possible, contributors should strive to produce documents written in proper English and that maintain the caliber of the community hivemind.
